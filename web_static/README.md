# AirBnB Clone - Web Static
This directory is the continuation of [The Console](https://github.com/MeritxellAdech/AirBnB_clone) version of the same project.

In this section, we develop the front end or Graphical User Interface.
The aim is to have the look and feel of the real AirBnb website.

## Learning Objectives
* Getting familiar with HTML and CSS
* Understanding the following concepts:
  * In HTML - html, head, body, header, footer, seaction, button, div, and other tags
  * In CSS - inline, internal, and external styles, selectors, properties and values
* CSS specification and its importances

## How to run
Each index file is built of another. It is wise to say that the very last index file is the main index file since it is the file with more content.

* Clone the repository - you have the green button at the top - on GitHub
* Install any text editor of your choice. (Notepad can do it as well)
* Open `web_static` directory from the cloned repository
* Navigate to the latest `index.html` file and open it with any browser of your choice to see what you have

## Others
No collaboration is needed at this point. 
Thank you and continue the journey!
